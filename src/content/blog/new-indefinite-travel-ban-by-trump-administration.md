No changes were made in today's order that impact refugees.
There continues to be a 120-day halt of the entire refugee program, which started on March 16, 2017.
Refugees with a bona fide relationship to a U.S. person or entity are exempt from the ban.
Currently, a formal assurance from a refugee resettlement agency is insufficient on its own to establish a bona fide relationship. This matter is under appeal.
The number of refugees to be admitted to the U.S. for fiscal year 2017 is reduced to 50,000.
