On January 15, 2016 the Dept. of Homeland Security finally published a final rule that makes it easier for specialty occupation workers from Australia who are on E-3 visas and workers from Chile and Singapore working in the US on H-1B1 visas.

Under the new final rule, a timely filed request for an extension of status for E-3 and H-1B1 employees will automatically extend the worker's employment authorization for 240 days while the extension request is pending. Previously, E-3 and H-1B1 employees were almost always required to travel abroad to get renewals of their visas at a U.S. consulate in order to extend their work authorization. Under the new rule those workers may remain in the US with work authorization.

These change of policy becomes effective February 16, 2016.
