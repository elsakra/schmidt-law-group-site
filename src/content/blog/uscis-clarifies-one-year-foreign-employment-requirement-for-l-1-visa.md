U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has published a policy memorandum, effective November 29, 2018, clarifying the requirement that a qualifying organization employ a principal L-1 beneficiary abroad for one continuous year out of the three years before the time of petition filing ("one-year foreign employment requirement"). This clarification is intended to ensure consistent adjudication of L-1 petitions by providing a standard basis for calculating time for the one-year foreign employment requirement.

The policy memo explains that the L-1 beneficiary must be physically outside the United States during the required one continuous year of employment, except for brief trips to the United States for business or pleasure. The beneficiary must have been employed for at least one year at a qualifying entity abroad when the visa petition is filed.
